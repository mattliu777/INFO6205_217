## Problem Describe:
Robi is a self-directed robot and its task is to pick up the garbage in a M*M map. In this game Robi have a limited steps of movements.  In the limited movements Robi need to get a grade as high as possible.

Unfortunately, Robi is only able to observe the 5 grid around him. The UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and  the grid the robot is staying.

Our goal is helping Robi find the best route(strategy) to get the heightest score(collect all soda cans without hitting walls and picking up nothing) by using Genetic Algorithms.
